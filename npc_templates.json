    "description": "The Metafold Wraith template allows the creation of bizarre victims of paracausality, whether the maddened survivors of an expedition into a metafold vault like DHIYED, the souls of a long-lost ghost ship in the cold void, or the power-mad villains who would willingly flay their metaphysical nature apart for just a scrap of MONIST enlightenment. Fighting Metafold Wraiths is frightening, disorientating, and comes with lingering scars in the form of Causality Leech tearing apart the fragile threats of a character’s future endeavours. Wraiths play havoc via movement manipulation and cycling resistances, and so can pose a serious threat to most mech team compositions. Combined with appropriate metafold scars, these can be quite complex NPCs to run, so be careful and ensure you’re on top of all the weirdness you’re about to inflict on your hapless players.",
